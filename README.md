# LockPort

## Requirments

- Be a Warlock!

## How it works:

- You must be in a group.
- If someone types 123 in Yell, Whisper, Party, Raid, or Raid Leader the Player name gets added to the LockPort list and is synced accros all LockPort users. Any user added to the list will also trigger a sound alert to let the Warlocks know someone is on the list.
- Type /lockport to show or hide the LockPort Window.
- Left click to Summon.
- CTRL + Left click to target the player.
- Right click to remove.
- If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /lockport to manually show).

## Utility:
- Type `/lockport summon` to fulfill the next pending summmon request via chatwindow or macro. Summons your target if there's no request.
- You can set a keybind to do the same in the keybinds menu.

## Options:

- /lockport help - Shows commands in chat.
- /lockport show - Shows the current summon list.
- /lockport settings - Opens the settings window.

## To Do:
- Make configurable prio list.
